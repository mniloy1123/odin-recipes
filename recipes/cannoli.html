    <h4>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the ricotta in a bowl and add the package of chestnuts, 2 tablespoons whipped cream and 1/2 cup of Maraschino
            liqueur.</li>
        <li>Carefully mix the ingredients together to form a uniform filling. Fill a pastry bag with this mixture and pipe it
            into 12 cannoli shells.</li>
        <li>Cut the chestnuts into pieces and use them to garnish the two ends of each of the cannoli. Place the pastries on
            individual dessert plates or on a serving tray, sprinkle them with powdered sugar and serve.</li>
        <li>Turn on the griddle, plancha or grill (or use a simple non-stick frying pan) and cook the involtini by
            turning them on both sides. You will need to obtain a lovely tasty crust. </li>
    </ol>
