    <h3>Sicilian-style Meat Rolls: Can't Stay Away!</h3>
    <p>Made with beef, caciocavallo and pecorino cheese, involtini (meat rolls)
        is an island tradition that drives both theyoung and old crazy,
        especially if theyâ€™re barbecued!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <em>Serves 4 people</em>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb thin slices of beef (carpaccio type)</li>
        <li>4 oz breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>7 oz caciocavallo cheese (better if Sicilian) or alternatively provolone
            cheese</li>
        <li>1 oz of Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>1 oz of pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>parsley, extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop pecorino cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic clove, salt, pepper
            and parsley. Mix everything with the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Lay the slices of meat on a flat surface and grease them lightly with oil. Place in the middle of each one a
            sprinkling of the freshly prepared mix and a cube of caciocavallo cheese.</li>
        <li>Roll up the meat and place several rolls (four or five) on skewers. Brush the skewers with oil and pass them
            through the seasoned breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Turn on the griddle, plancha or grill (or use a simple non-stick frying pan) and cook the involtini by
            turning them on both sides. You will need to obtain a lovely tasty crust. </li>
        <li>Serve them hot.</li>
